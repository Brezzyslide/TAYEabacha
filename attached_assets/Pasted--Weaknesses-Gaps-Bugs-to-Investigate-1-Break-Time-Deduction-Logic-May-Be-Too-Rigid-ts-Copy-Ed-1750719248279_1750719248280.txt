‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses / Gaps / Bugs to Investigate
1. Break Time Deduction Logic May Be Too Rigid
ts
Copy
Edit
const breakMinutes = totalMinutes > 240 ? 30 : 0;
‚úÖ Simple and Aware of Award

‚ùå But: Some awards permit different breaks for 6+ hour shifts or night work.

üõ†Ô∏è Solution: Allow break duration override from shift metadata or staff contract profile. Also future-proof for enterprise agreement customisation.

2. Floating-Point Rounding Risk in Pay Calculations
ts
Copy
Edit
grossPay = hours √ó hourlyRate
This is fine on paper, but floats will kill you at scale (e.g. 1c errors √ó 3000 shifts).

üõ†Ô∏è Fix: Convert hours * rate to cents (integer math) early:

ts
Copy
Edit
const grossPayCents = Math.round(hours * hourlyRate * 100);
const grossPay = grossPayCents / 100;
3. YTD Gross Assumption Might Be Off
ts
Copy
Edit
calculatePayroll(userId, tenantId, grossPay, ytdGross)
YTD needs to be recalculated live, not trusted from prior state (in case of reversals or retro approvals).

üõ†Ô∏è Solution: Always query SUM(grossPay) from approved/published timesheets up to that date rather than storing a ytdGross snapshot.

4. No Explicit Mention of Shift Allowances
SCHADS includes:

Sleepover allowance

Broken shift allowance

Saturday/Sunday/Public Holiday penalty rates

‚ùå If not already in pay_scales, this is a major gap.

üõ†Ô∏è Patch:

Add shift metadata: { isPublicHoliday, isWeekend, isSleepover }

Add support for baseRate + allowance stacks

5. Super Contribution Source Not Specified
The logic adds 11%, but is that:

On ordinary time earnings (OTE)?

Excluding leave loading?

üõ†Ô∏è Fix: Document your base, and ensure only eligible payments are used for super:

ts
Copy
Edit
superContribution = ordinaryTimeEarnings √ó 0.11
6. No Reverse Deduction or Timesheet Update Flow
What happens if:

A shift is ‚Äúun-completed‚Äù?

Timesheet is rejected after submission?

‚ùå No clear undo logic for:

Removing auto-generated entries

Recalculating tax and leave

üõ†Ô∏è Patch: Add a reversal flow:

ts
Copy
Edit
await removeTimesheetEntryByShiftId(shiftId)
recalculateTimesheetTotal(timesheetId)
7. Payslip PDF Path May Not Cache Branding Correctly
ts
Copy
Edit
GET /api/payslips/:id/pdf
‚ùìDoes it:

Pull company name, logo, footer from tenant metadata?

Or hardcoded?

üõ†Ô∏è Fix: Cache branding + ABN inside each payslip record on generation for audit permanence.

üß∞ Fix Summary & Rewrite Plan
Area	Fix / Patch
Break deduction	Make flexible by role/contract; not hardcoded
Rounding errors	Use integer math for all financials (convert to cents)
YTD gross	Always calculate live from approved records
Allowances	Add metadata and dynamic allowance logic
Super base	Restrict to OTE-only if you're not already
Reversal flow	Add removeTimesheetEntryFromShiftId() + recalc
Payslip branding	Lock in ABN, company name, and logo on PDF gen time
