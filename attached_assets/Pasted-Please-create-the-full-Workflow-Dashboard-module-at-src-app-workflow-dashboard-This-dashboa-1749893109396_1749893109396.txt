Please create the full Workflow Dashboard module at:

📁 `src/app/workflow-dashboard/`

This dashboard should have **two distinct, clearly labeled sections**:

---

## 1️⃣ SECTION: 🧠 Auto Insights Panel (Top of Page)

Component: `AutoInsightsPanel.tsx`

This section automatically displays reminders and alerts pulled from across the system:

Each card should evaluate the following logic using `useWorkflowInsights()`:

### Reminder Triggers:
- **Unstarted shifts past start time** → “3 shifts are overdue to start”
- **Open incidents older than 48 hrs** → “1 incident still unresolved”
- **Medication plans with no record today** → “2 clients have no logged medication”
- **Clients with no case notes in 7 days** → “Client [X] has no case note this week”
- **Staff with hoursUsed ≥ 90% of allocation** → “Staff [Y] is nearing allocation cap”

Use:
- `TanStack Query` to fetch data from:
  - `incidentReports`
  - `medicationRecords`
  - `caseNotes`
  - `hourAllocations`
  - `shifts`

Display each insight as a **Card** with:
- Title
- Detail
- Icon
- Optional “Go to” button (linking to relevant module)

---

## 2️⃣ SECTION: 🗂️ Manual Task Board (Bottom of Page)

Component: `ManualTaskBoard.tsx`

Trello-style Kanban board with 3 columns:
- **To Do**
- **In Progress**
- **Completed**

Use `dnd-kit` or `react-beautiful-dnd` to enable drag-and-drop across columns.

Each task card should include:
- Task Title
- Assigned Staff (dropdown)
- Due Date & Time (picker)
- Notes (optional tooltip or modal)
- Created by (autofill current user)

---

### Task Storage Schema (`taskBoardTasks`)
```ts
{
  id,
  companyId,
  title,
  description?,
  status: "todo" | "in-progress" | "done",
  dueDateTime,
  assignedToUserId,
  createdByUserId,
  createdAt,
  updatedAt
}
Permissions:
Role	Can View	Can Create/Edit Tasks
SupportWorker	Only tasks assigned to them	❌ (view only)
Team Leader	All team tasks	✅
Admin	All company tasks	✅

UI Requirements:
Top section titled: "🔔 Workflow Alerts (System-Generated)"

Bottom section titled: "📋 Task Board (Manual Tasks)"

Sticky header to separate the two visually

Full responsiveness (mobile-ready)

Use Tailwind + ShadCN
