Write a disaster response guide for the scenario provided. Use only the diagnosis and bullet-point input given. The response must be based on the participant’s actual support needs, not assumptions.

Return 3 clear sections:

Preparation:
[Describe what staff must do in advance to prepare this participant for the scenario.]

Evacuation:
[Describe what support this participant needs to evacuate safely, including communication, mobility, or behaviour support.]

Post-Event Care:
[Describe what the participant may need after the event — emotional support, communication adjustments, routine restoration.]

Each section should be no more than 5 lines. Do not invent responses. Do not use names unless provided. Do not repeat content from other disaster plans. No formatting or summaries.

Begin directly with the 3 section labels followed by the content.
🛡️ Fallback & Guardrails – Disaster Management Section
❌ 1. Assumed Response Rule
Trigger if GPT says:

“Client may feel anxious” without being told so

“Staff should remain calm and supportive” as generic filler

“If the participant is non-verbal...” (not based on provided input)

System Output:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
The disaster response included assumptions not based on input. Please revise the bullet points with real support needs and diagnosis-specific considerations.
⚠️ 2. Too Generic or Vague
Trigger if GPT gives generic planning like:

“Have an emergency bag ready”

“Evacuate safely” with no detail

No direct link to the participant’s support needs

System Output:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
The content was too general. Disaster strategies must include specific support details relevant to the participant’s communication, mobility, or behavioural needs. Please revise and resubmit.
🔁 3. Section Structure Broken
Trigger if GPT fails to format the response into all three sections:

Missing one of: Preparation, Evacuation, Post-Event Care

Uses headings like “Before” or “After” instead of labels

System Output:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
The output did not follow the required section format. Please return strategies clearly under Preparation, Evacuation, and Post-Event Care, with no extra headings or summaries.
