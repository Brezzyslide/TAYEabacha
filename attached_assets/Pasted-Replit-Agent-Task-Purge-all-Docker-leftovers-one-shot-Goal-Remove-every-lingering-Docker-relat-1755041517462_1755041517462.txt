Replit Agent Task — Purge all Docker leftovers (one-shot)

Goal: Remove every lingering Docker-related file or reference from the repo so the codebase reflects a development-only setup. Do not touch node_modules.

Scope rules:
- READ/WRITE allowed across repo, but DO NOT modify node_modules or lockfiles unless explicitly required.
- After changes, run a quick grep to verify nothing Docker-related remains (except within node_modules).

Step 1 — Identify candidates (no deletes yet; list paths)
Search the repo (excluding node_modules) for these patterns/filenames:
- Files: Dockerfile, Dockerfile.*, .dockerignore, docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.yaml, docker-compose.*.yml, docker-compose.*.yaml
- Shell/CI scripts: **/*docker*.sh, **/ci-test.sh, **/docker-*.sh
- GitHub Actions using Docker/buildx: .github/workflows/** with actions like docker/build-push-action, docker/setup-buildx-action, docker/login-action
- Any scripts in package.json containing “docker”, “buildx”, “compose”
- Markdown/docs with Docker build/run commands (grep for: “docker build”, “docker run”, “docker compose”)

Print a numbered list of all matches with path + a short reason (e.g., “GitHub Action uses docker/build-push-action”).

Step 2 — Delete/strip safely
For each item found:
A) If it’s a dedicated Docker artifact (files below) → DELETE the file:
   - Dockerfile*, .dockerignore, docker-compose*.yml/.yaml, **/*docker*.sh, **/ci-test.sh
B) If it’s a GitHub Action workflow that exists only to build/push Docker → DELETE that workflow file.
   - If a workflow does many things and Docker is just one job, then REMOVE ONLY the Docker job(s)/steps and keep the rest intact.
C) If package.json contains “docker” scripts → REMOVE those script entries (leave all other scripts unchanged).
D) If README/markdown contains clearly separated Docker sections (headings like “## Docker”, “### Build with Docker”) → REMOVE those sections only. If not clearly separated, leave docs untouched.

Step 3 — Sanity checks
- Ensure package.json remains valid JSON after script removals.
- Ensure .github/workflows still parse if edited (YAML validity).
- Do NOT delete any non-Docker CI or dev tooling.

Step 4 — Verify purge (read-only grep)
Run a case-insensitive search (excluding node_modules) for:
- “docker ”, “ docker”, “buildx”, “docker-compose”, “FROM node:”, “docker/build-push-action”
Report any remaining matches (show path + line). If all clear, say “No Docker references remain.”

Step 5 — Output a clear summary
- Files deleted (with paths)
- Files edited (with paths + what changed)
- Remaining references (if any), with suggested manual action

chore: remove all Docker infrastructure and references for dev-only posture
