TASK OBJECTIVE:

Update the care support plan PDF export logic to ensure that all 8 core sections, including structured entries like routine_entries, are included in the final exported PDF. Activities entered through the "Structure & Routine" section (like day/time/scheduled activities) must be displayed in full detail.

REQUIREMENTS:

Data Source:
All sections must be fetched from the care_support_plans table. The following fields must be included in the export:

about_me_data

goals_data

adl_data

structure_data.routine_entries

communication_data

behaviour_data

disaster_data

mealtime_data

Handle Nested Fields:

For structure_data, extract the routine_entries[] array and render it as a table.

Each routine entry includes:

Day

Time Range (start - end)

Activity Description

Category (optional)

Priority

Layout Requirements (for PDF or React-to-PDF):

Add a heading: Structure and Routine

Below the heading, display a table with the following columns:

sql
Copy
Edit
| Day      | Time        | Activity Description                  | Category       | Priority       |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Tuesday  | 10:51-10:51 | GENERAL WRITING STYLE - Clinical...   | (If present)   | Medium Priority|
Loop through all entries under routine_entries and render them in this format.

For All Other Sections:

Display content as a block section under its heading (e.g., "About Me", "Goals", "ADL Support", etc.)

For fields that are missing or null, display “No data provided.”

Formatting Rules:

Use a clean, printable layout (A4 PDF).

Use Australian date format DD/MM/YYYY.

Include:

Client Name

NDIS Number

Company Branding Header

Export Timestamp in the footer

Use consistent font, spacing, and section breaks.

Fail Gracefully:

If routine_entries is missing or empty, display:

“No routine activities recorded.”

Add to Export Route:
Update the export endpoint /api/care-support-plans/:id/export/pdf to include the above data when building the document.

STRUCTURE AND ROUTINE

| Day      | Time        | Activity Description                  | Category       | Priority       |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Tuesday  | 10:51-10:51 | GENERAL WRITING STYLE - Clinical...   | Routine        | Medium Priority|
✅ BONUS (Optional but ideal):
If using react-pdf or puppeteer, ensure table rows wrap if activity description is long.

Respect mobile/desktop printing constraints.
