ðŸŸ¦ NDIS Goals
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Write NDIS-aligned goals based on the participantâ€™s diagnosis and known support needs. Focus on independence, community access, social interaction, skill development, and capacity building.

Each goal must be specific, measurable, and achievable â€” written like it belongs in a formal support plan. Do not generalise or fabricate outcomes. Use only whatâ€™s in the input.

Do not use names unless provided. Do not repeat content from other goal sections. No formatting, stars, or summaries. Just the actual goals.

Max 200 words total.
ðŸŸ¨ Personal Goals
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Write personal goals that reflect the participantâ€™s values, interests, and life aspirations.

Avoid clinical language. Focus on what the person wants to do or experience â€” relationships, home life, routines, hobbies, or self-expression. Do not duplicate NDIS or support goals. Use only the information provided.

No names unless given. No assumptions. No list formatting or headings. Just write the content naturally and clearly.

Max 200 words.
ðŸŸ© Short-Term Goals
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Write clear, achievable goals that the participant can work towards over the next 3â€“6 months.

Focus on daily living skills, communication, safety, behaviour support, or routine-building based on their diagnosis. Each goal must be written in a way that staff can actively support or measure progress.

No invented needs. No names unless given. No formatting. Donâ€™t overlap with long-term or personal goals.

Start directly with the goal content. Max 200 words.

Do not repeat short-term or personal goals. No names unless supplied. Do not use symbols, formatting, or made-up examples.
