Please create a full-featured NDIS Budget Management system in:

📁 `src/app/budget-management/`

This module must include:

---

## 1️⃣ Participant Budget Setup

File: `ParticipantBudgetForm.tsx`

Fields:
- Client (dropdown filtered by `companyId`)
- NDIS Budget Categories:
  - SIL: total + remaining
  - Community Access: total + remaining
  - Capacity Building: total + remaining
- Allowed Ratios per category (multi-select: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4)
- Optional: price overrides per shift type (AM, PM, Active Night, Sleepover)

🧾 On Submit:
Save to `ndisBudgets` table:
```ts
{
  clientId,
  companyId,
  sil: { total, remaining, allowedRatios: string[] },
  communityAccess: { ... },
  capacityBuilding: { ... },
  priceOverrides?: {
    AM?: number,
    PM?: number,
    ActiveNight?: number,
    Sleepover?: number
  }
}
2️⃣ Connect Shift to Budget Logic
Update NewShiftModal.tsx (in shift-calendar) to include:

Shift Type (auto-calculated or manual)

Funding Category (dropdown: SIL, Access, Capacity)

🧠 Auto-set shiftType based on time:

ts
Copy
Edit
06:00–20:00 → AM  
20:00–00:00 → PM  
00:00–06:00 → Active Night
3️⃣ Deduct Budget on Case Note Submission
In CreateCaseNoteModal.tsx:

When a shift is completed and linked to a case note:

Pull shiftType, fundingType, ratio, and hours

Lookup rate from ndisPricing

Calculate:

ts
Copy
Edit
cost = rate × hours × ratioMultiplier
Subtract from participant’s remainingBudget for that category

4️⃣ Budget Overview Component
File: BudgetSummaryCard.tsx

Show total, remaining, and used per category

Progress bar visual

Available to Admins + Team Leaders
