## 💬 Strategic Messaging Bubbles (Floating UI)

Implement the following messages as slow-floating, animated "bubble text" elements across the page background:

- “Built by and for people who do the work — not tech bros.”
- “PBS in every button — not just every plan.”
- “Every shift structured. Every life supported.”
- “NDIS-ready. Compliance isn’t a feature — it’s the foundation.”
- “Supports NDIS funding applications with evidence-backed care design.”
- “Made for staff. Trusted by coordinators. Loved by participants.”

Bubbles should:
- Fade in/out
- Shift gently across page margins
- Hide gracefully on mobile if space-constrained
