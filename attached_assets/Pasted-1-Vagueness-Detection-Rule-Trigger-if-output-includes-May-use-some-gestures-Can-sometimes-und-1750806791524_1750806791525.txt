1. Vagueness Detection Rule
Trigger if output includes:

“May use some gestures”

“Can sometimes understand instructions”

“Often communicates in their own way”

“Supportive communication is helpful”

Phrases like “may”, “usually”, “can be” used more than twice

Output is under 40 words

Fallback Message (to user):

plaintext
Copy
Edit
The content was too vague. Please provide clearer input about how the participant expresses and receives communication. Include examples such as: uses gestures, prefers short sentences, needs repeated prompts, or uses a device.
🚫 2. Assumption Rule
Trigger if GPT generates:

Tools, apps, or devices not mentioned in input (e.g. “communication iPad”, “Proloquo2Go app”)

Signing systems not confirmed (e.g. “uses Auslan” without prompt)

Strategies not linked to diagnosis or user input

Refusal Output:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
The system detected unsupported content. The communication output included tools or strategies not provided in the input. Please remove any assumptions and supply real examples used with this participant.
🔄 3. Field Overlap Rule
Trigger if GPT repeats expressive content in receptive field, or vice versa

System Warning:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
This output repeated content from another communication field. Please ensure each section is focused only on its specific purpose — either how the participant expresses or how they receive and process communication.
📉 4. Non-Actionable or Empty Content
Trigger if:

GPT returns only one or two sentences without verbs or strategies

Output includes: “Not applicable”, “None known”, “To be determined”

Fallback:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
The communication field returned no meaningful content. If this information is not yet known, please leave the section blank or revisit after gathering more support observations.
⚙️ 5. JSON Enforcement for General Prompt
Trigger if response from General Communication prompt:

Does not include keys: "generatedContent", "receptiveStrategies", "expressiveStrategies"

Exceeds 200 words

Inserts placeholder text or summaries

System Response:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
The output did not match the required format. Communication summaries must include structured JSON with receptive and expressive strategies separated. Please retry using only provided input and valid strategy descriptions.
