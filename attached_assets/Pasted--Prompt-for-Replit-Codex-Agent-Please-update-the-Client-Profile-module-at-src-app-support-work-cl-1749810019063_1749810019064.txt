# Prompt for Replit Codex Agent

Please update the Client Profile module at `src/app/support-work/client-profile/` with the following:

---

### 1. ðŸŽ¨ Revamp Create Client Form

In `CreateClientForm.tsx`, update the structure to reflect the latest version shown:

- Basic Information:
  - First Name *
  - Last Name *
  - NDIS Number *
  - Date of Birth *
  - Address
  - Emergency Contact: name + phone

- Care & Support:
  - NDIS Goals
  - Likes & Preferences
  - Dislikes & Aversions
  - Allergies & Medical Alerts

Remove any unnecessary required fields from the legacy staff form structure.

Store this in a clean `clients` table, and auto-generate a unique `clientId`. Enforce `companyId` for tenant isolation.

---

### 2. ðŸ§¾ Client Cards + Quick Actions

In `ClientListPage.tsx`:

- Card view of active clients with:
  - Name, NDIS number, address
  - Emergency contact preview
  - Tags: "Active", "Allergies" (if any listed)
- Menu on card (`...`) should allow:
  - Quick View
  - Full Profile
  - Edit Profile
  - Archive

---

### 3. ðŸ’Š Medication Tab Integration in Client Profile

Inside `client-profile/tabs/medications.tsx`:

Include the following:

#### A. Medication Analytics:
- Line/Bar chart of last 7 days: doses administered/refused
- Pie chart showing time-of-day (AM/PM/Night) breakdown
- Per-medication adherence bars (e.g., Paracetamol 33.3%, Panadol 66.7%)

#### B. Active Medication Plans:
- Display as cards
- Show name, dosage, frequency, route, start date, plan type
- Include "Record Administration" button on each

#### C. Recent Administrations:
- List of last 5â€“10 records
- Status badge (administered/refused)
- Time, staff, notes/refusal reason

All data filtered by `clientId` and `companyId`.

---

### 4. ðŸ›¡ Access & Security

- SupportWorker: can only see assigned clients and create administration records
- Team Leader/Coordinator: can edit plans for assigned clients
- Admin: full access to edit plans and export data

---

### 5. ðŸ§  Utility

- Add export buttons (PDF, Excel)
- Support switching between `Card View` and `List View` for records
- Cleanly styled using Tailwind and ShadCN UI

Use:
- TanStack Query
- `react-hook-form` + `zod` for validations
- Role-check wrapper for tabs and actions
