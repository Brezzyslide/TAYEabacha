# Prompt for Replit Codex Agent

Please scaffold a full Shift Work Assignment module at:

`src/app/shift-management/`

### 1. Create a page: `ShiftCalendar.tsx`

This should display a calendar (use `react-big-calendar` or similar), showing:

- All shifts for the current company (`companyId`)
- Color-coded by status: 
  - Unassigned (grey)
  - Assigned (blue)
  - In progress (green)
- Staff can only see their assigned shifts or unassigned ones
- Admins can see all shifts for the company

### 2. Clicking a shift:

- If Admin: open `EditShiftModal`
- If Staff & unassigned: show confirmation modal to request shift â†’ creates shift request for admin
- If Staff & assigned: show shift details and allow `Start Shift` / `End Shift` (auto timestamp + location)

### 3. Create a `NewShiftModal.tsx` with:
- Shift title
- Start Date & Time
- End Date & Time
- Assign to Client (dropdown from client directory, filtered by companyId)
- Assign to Staff (optional; dropdown from staff list)
- Toggle: "Recurring Shift"
  - If enabled, show recurrence type: Weekly / Fortnightly / Monthly
  - Choose: 
    - Number of occurrences (text input), OR
    - End date (calendar picker)
- Button to save shift
- If assigned to a client, show under their schedule (filtered by clientId)
- If assigned to a staff, also appears in staffâ€™s shift calendar

### 4. My Shifts Page:

- For staff: a calendar showing only assigned shifts
- Tabs at top: `My Shifts`, `Shift Requests`
- "Start Shift" â†’ captures timestamp, location, sets status to in progress
- "End Shift" â†’ captures timestamp and closes the shift

### 5. Admin Approvals:

- Admins can view shift requests
- Accept or Reject via `AdminShiftRequestPanel.tsx`
- If accepted, assign staff to shift and mark as assigned

### 6. Enforce:
- `companyId` filtering for every shift query
- `clientId` filtering for views like Client Schedule
- Role checks: staff vs admin vs coordinator

Use:
- ShadCN UI for all inputs, cards, calendar overlay
- TanStack Query for fetch + mutation
- Location: mock with browser geolocation or placeholder for now
