# Prompt for Replit Codex Agent

Please create a complete Staff Hour Allocation module with analytics and shift enforcement at:

üìÅ `src/app/staff-hour-allocations/`

This module should allow admins to allocate working hour caps for each staff member (weekly or fortnightly), display analytics, and prevent overscheduling unless overridden.

---

### 1. Dashboard: `StaffHourDashboard.tsx`

Sections:
- **Header Cards**:
  - Total Allocations
  - Weekly Allocations
  - Fortnightly Allocations

- **Shift Analytics**:
  - Total Shifts (count + total hours)
  - Allocated Hours (used)
  - Unallocated Hours (available)
  - Allocation Rate (as %)

- **Workforce Planning Overview**:
  - Allocated vs Available shifts
  - Insights:
    - Coverage Status
    - Available Capacity
    - Workforce Utilization

- **Current Allocations**:
  - Cards per staff:
    - Staff name
    - Period (weekly/fortnightly)
    - Hours Used / Max Hours
    - Progress bar
    - Edit / Delete buttons

---

### 2. Create/Edit Modal: `CreateAllocationModal.tsx`

Fields:
- Staff Member (dropdown filtered by `companyId`)
- Period: Weekly or Fortnightly
- Max Allowed Hours (numeric)

On submit:
Save to `hourAllocations` table:
```ts
{
  id,
  companyId,
  staffId,
  allocationPeriod: "weekly" | "fortnightly",
  maxHours: number,
  hoursUsed: number,
  remainingHours: number,
  createdAt
}
3. Staff View: MyAllocationCard.tsx
Path: src/app/staff-availability/quick-patterns.tsx

Show:

4. Shift Enforcement Logic
In NewShiftModal.tsx or AssignShiftDialog.tsx, add:

On staff selection:

Fetch hourAllocations for staff

Calculate total hoursUsed + new shift duration

If it exceeds maxHours:

Show warning modal:

css

Edit
This shift exceeds the staff member‚Äôs allocated hours for this period.
[ Proceed Anyway ] [ Cancel ]
Only allow proceed if user is Team Leader or Admin

On confirmation:

Update hoursUsed in hourAllocations

Update remainingHours
