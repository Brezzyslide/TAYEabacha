## Changelog
- July 23, 2025. **COMPLETE BEHAVIOUR SUPPORT FIELD-SPECIFIC AND BULK AI GENERATION IMPLEMENTED** - Successfully completed comprehensive field-specific AI generation for Behaviour Support section with individual "Add to Proactive/Reactive/Protective Strategy" buttons replacing single generation button. Enhanced backend to handle field-specific behaviour strategy generation using actual wizard-entered triggers instead of assumed content. Each strategy type (proactive/preventative, reactive/immediate response, protective/post-behaviour) generates targeted 150-200 word clinical content specific to documented behaviour description and triggers. Implemented section-wide bulk generation features: "Generate De-escalation Techniques" and "Generate PBS Tips" buttons that work across all behaviours in section. Backend supports bulk generation with comprehensive prompts creating universal techniques applicable to all documented behaviours. System uses client diagnosis and documented behaviour patterns to generate evidence-based staff guidance. Strategy content appending preserves existing field content while adding AI-generated content. All generation follows universal prompt header restrictions ensuring NDIS compliance and clinical tone.
- July 23, 2025. **COMPLETE FIELD-SPECIFIC AI GENERATION FOR GOALS, ADL, AND COMMUNICATION SECTIONS IMPLEMENTED** - Successfully completed comprehensive field-specific AI generation across Goals, ADL, and Communication sections matching the About Me section architecture. Goals section features individual "Add to" buttons for all 5 fields (NDIS Goals, Personal Goals, Short-Term Goals, Long-Term Goals, Overall Objective) with dedicated backend prompts. ADL section enhanced with field-specific generation for all 8 ADL areas (Personal Care, Mobility, Household Tasks, Community Access, Safety, Independence, Assistive Technology, Recommendations). Communication section now includes field-specific generation for 4 communication domains (Expressive Communication, Receptive Communication, Assistive Technology, Support Strategies) with domain-specific backend prompts targeting therapeutic focus areas. All sections include enhanced AI content preview functionality with cross-field application buttons allowing users to review and apply generated content to any relevant field. Backend implements targeted generation logic with client context integration ensuring diagnosis-appropriate content for each field type. System maintains clinical tone and NDIS compliance standards across all field-specific generation with proper pronoun handling and universal restrictions.
- July 23, 2025. **CRITICAL AI PRONOUN CONSISTENCY SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED** - Resolved all gender-aware pronoun inconsistencies in AI-generated care plan content through comprehensive detection and correction system. Enhanced pronoun detection logic that analyzes client name patterns to determine appropriate pronouns (he/him/his vs she/her/her) and applies them consistently across ALL AI generation prompts. Updated universal prompt headers throughout all sections (About Me, Goals, ADL, Communication, Structure, Behaviour, Disaster, Mealtime) to use dynamic pronoun templates instead of hardcoded gender assumptions. Implemented post-processing content cleanup that automatically corrects any remaining pronoun mismatches after AI generation using pattern-based replacement system. Added comprehensive debugging logs for pronoun detection and application. Enhanced fallback content generation to use correct client-specific pronouns. System now generates fully consistent, gender-appropriate content eliminating issues like "his diagnosis" followed by "Sarah Johnson" mixups, ensuring professional clinical documentation meets gender-respectful care planning standards.
- July 17, 2025. **SYSTEM-WIDE AI PERSONALIZATION COMPREHENSIVE FIX COMPLETED** - Resolved critical system-wide issue where all care plan sections (Goals, ADL, Communication, Structure, Behaviour, Disaster, Mealtime) were using generic placeholders instead of client-specific data. Implemented comprehensive diagnosis extraction system with extractDiagnosis() function that parses clinical conditions from About Me content. Enhanced auto-save endpoint to store extracted diagnosis separately in aboutMeData.diagnosis field. Applied comprehensive client data integration to ALL sections ensuring every section now: uses extracted diagnosis from About Me (prioritized over client primaryDiagnosis), accesses comprehensive client information (name, age, NDIS goals, preferences, dislikes), considers previous section content for context-aware generation, replaces all "[Client Name]" placeholders with actual client names, implements enhanced debugging for complete data flow tracking. System now generates fully personalized content across ALL sections using Christopher Camara's specific BPD diagnosis and documented preferences instead of generic templates.
- July 17, 2025. **INTELLIGENT GOALS SYSTEM WITH AUTO-SAVE FIX COMPLETED** - Implemented sophisticated two-button Goals system: "Generate Goals" uses documented NDIS goals + About Me content for NDIS Goals field, "Add to Personal Aspirations" breaks down previous sections for Personal Aspirations field. Added personalAspirations field to Goals section with separate handling for NDIS Goals vs Personal Aspirations. Fixed critical auto-save data persistence issue where About Me field data disappeared when navigating between sections by enhancing auto-save detection logic to include all About Me fields (personalHistory, interests, preferences, strengths, challenges, familyBackground, culturalConsiderations) plus new personalAspirations field. Auto-save now properly triggers on changes to individual About Me fields ensuring data persistence across wizard navigation.
- July 21, 2025. **COMPREHENSIVE PDF EXPORT WITH DETAILED TABLE FORMATTING COMPLETED** - Enhanced care support plan PDF export with detailed table formatting for all 4 critical sections.

## Multi-Tenant Development Protocol

### Critical Multi-Tenant Requirements
1. **All features MUST work consistently across ALL tenants/companies**
2. **ALL changes must automatically carry through to existing and new tenants**
3. **Frontend code changes are automatically available to all tenants**
4. **Backend data/features require automatic tenant provisioning integration**
5. **Permission systems must respect tenant boundaries while ensuring role consistency**
6. **Every feature implementation requires testing across multiple tenants**
7. **Admin users must have full company access without cross-tenant restrictions**

### Multi-Tenant Testing Checklist
Before marking any feature complete:
- [ ] Test with ConsoleManager (global access)
- [ ] Test with Admin from Company A 
- [ ] Test with Admin from Company B
- [ ] Verify data isolation between companies
- [ ] Confirm permission consistency across tenants

### Development Guidelines
- Admin role = Full company access (not cross-company)
- ConsoleManager role = Global system access
- Features implemented for one tenant must work for all tenants
- Permission logic must not block legitimate role access within tenant boundaries
