## Multi-Tenant Development Protocol

### Critical Multi-Tenant Requirements
1. **All features MUST work consistently across ALL tenants/companies**
2. **ALL changes must automatically carry through to existing and new tenants**
3. **Frontend code changes are automatically available to all tenants**
4. **Backend data/features require automatic tenant provisioning integration**
5. **Permission systems must respect tenant boundaries while ensuring role consistency**
6. **Every feature implementation requires testing across multiple tenants**
7. **Admin users must have full company access without cross-tenant restrictions**

### Multi-Tenant Testing Checklist
Before marking any feature complete:
- [ ] Test with ConsoleManager (global access)
- [ ] Test with Admin from Company A 
- [ ] Test with Admin from Company B
- [ ] Verify data isolation between companies
- [ ] Confirm permission consistency across tenants

### Development Guidelines
- Admin role = Full company access (not cross-company)
- ConsoleManager role = Global system access
- Features implemented for one tenant must work for all tenants
- Permission logic must not block legitimate role access within tenant boundaries
